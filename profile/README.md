# Lume Web: Shaping the Future of Web3

Welcome to Lume Web, where decentralized technologies meet everyone. Our goal: an internet without limits, focused on privacy, ownership, and access. As Web3 unfolds, Lume Web leads, guiding you into this new era.

Web3 for us combines the decentralized web (dWeb) â€“ think BitTorrent, Tor, Scuttlebutt, and IPFS â€“ with blockchain-based economies. While views on web3 differ, we converge dWeb and digital economies. Our vision? An internet prioritizing access and freedom.

But there's more. Lume Web extends beyond decentralized finance (defi), envisioning a digital landscape of openness. Join us in rewriting the rules and designing a user-centric internet.
